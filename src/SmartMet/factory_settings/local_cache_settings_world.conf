# Local hard drive queryData-cache is possible to set. The purpose of this is to avoid

# Local cache base directory can be changed from SmartMet's Settings dialog.
# This configurational change forces one directory set point and some default named
# subdirectories under the base: local, partial_data, tmp, cache
# 'local' stores 'normal' queryData files (like model and observation data)
# 'partial_data' stores datafiles where each file contains own time slice which are meant to be combined
# 'tmp' stores temporal data copied from network to a local directory, when copying is finished, file is moved to final directory
# 'cache' contains data generated by combining time slice files or if soundingIndex data is generated from some level-data
# 'edited' contains working edited data generated by saves after changies after modifying the data with different tools
